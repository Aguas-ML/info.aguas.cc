<p>One letter about our work</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The commons in colony</strong></h2><p>We are a very beautiful and complex process of preserving the historical and environmental heritage of Col√¥nia Capoava, in Porto Feliz, Brazil.</p><p>In the colony, which is over 150 years old, we are almost 100 families living in a beautiful oasis of old buildings amid beautiful trees and springs. The potential for sustainable communities is huge!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Summarizing the history of the NGO</strong></h2><p>Our nonprofit work blends in with our personal lives. So it's been intense, fun and very dynamic, lots of wins and hard learning, of course!</p><p>We started our activities in 2004 and since then we have strengthened many projects, autonomous collectives and experimental initiatives in the spaces we operate. Connecting nature with technologies and people is one of our qualities. Sometimes we call this BioTechnoSwarm :)</p><p>We are also connected with the UN initiative called Harmony with Nature (HwN), which works to guarantee the rights of nature. We have a lot of others global connections in the mindset of the project.</p><p>In the last two years we are being studied by a research from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The research seeks in hackerspaces (we have had one since 2015) the potential for Grassroots Innovation Movements. Last week they published an article, in English, and we are an object in the study.</p><p>LINK: <a href="https://seer.ufrgs.br/EmQuestao/article/view/89892">https://seer.ufrgs.br/EmQuestao/article/view/89892</a></p><p>We are rediscovering who we are too :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Our Support Network</h2><p>We are good in the field and on the internet, among other technologies like Permaculture.</p><p>This gives us relationships beyond our territory, opens many paths that we connect in what we call the Support Network.&nbsp;</p><p>There are hundreds of people, institutions, small businesses and universities connected by us, virtually or in person. Little money available internally, we work in a plenty of resource mobilization.</p><p>And if you are here, it's means that you can join in our Support Network!<br><br>The reason? We would like to count on with your experiences! And we love when someone new is introduced, so many positive thoughts come up!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>So, to be practical</h3><p>At Capoava we want, we believe that we can speak for almost everyone involved, to ensure the preservation of the historical heritage, Human Rights and Nature Rights of the beings living in the colony.</p><p>It is natural to think of sustainable development strategies. We are following the local and global discussions about the climate, which is very distressing to us.</p><p>As we have many needs, we are working in many projects.</p><p>To manage this, we are creating a rural Think tank, one cybernetic associative organization which could boost our work, our worlds.</p><p>Welcome to the:</p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>P</strong>ermacultural <strong>O</strong>ffice of <strong>R</strong>esilience <strong>T</strong>hrough the <strong>O</strong>pen-Earth</p><p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;or just PORTO Rural</p><p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
